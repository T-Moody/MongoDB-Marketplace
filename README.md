# MongoDB-Marketplace
Create a marketplace with user registration and sign in capabilities. User will be able to add and buy items.

The main purpose of this application was for me to strengthen my backend skills as well as get some practice connecting it to a front-end.

Master deployed at https://tylermoodymarketplace.herokuapp.com/

The backend still has some unused routes such allowing users to delete accounts and a route that gets all products.
